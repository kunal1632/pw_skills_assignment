    "Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to transform numeric features to a common scale. It rescales the values of the features to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. Min-Max scaling helps to ensure that all features contribute equally and prevents features with larger value ranges from dominating the analysis or model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Min-Max scaling works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the minimum and maximum values of the feature you want to scale. Let's say we have a feature \"age\" with a minimum value of 25 and a maximum value of 65 in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the desired range for scaling. Typically, it is between 0 and 1, but it can also be any other range based on the specific needs of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Apply the Min-Max scaling formula to each value in the feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- scaled_value = (original_value - minimum_value) / (maximum_value - minimum_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, to scale an age value of 35:\n",
    "\n",
    "- scaled_value = (35 - 25) / (65 - 25) = 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scaled value for 35 using Min-Max scaling is 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat the scaling process for all values in the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset with a feature \"income\" that ranges from $30,000 to $100,000. To apply Min-Max scaling, we can normalize the income values to a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original values: [30000, 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000]\n",

    "- scaled_value_1 = (30000 - 30000) / (100000 - 30000) = 0\n",

    "- scaled_value_3 = (60000 - 30000) / (100000 - 30000) = 0.4\n",
