    "\n",
    "- Example: An example of AI is a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.

    "2. Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn patterns from data and use them to make informed decisions or predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: An example of machine learning is spam email filtering. ML algorithms can be trained on a large dataset of emails, with labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails. By learning from these examples, the algorithm can identify patterns and features that distinguish spam emails, and subsequently classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam.\n",

    "- Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained on large datasets of images to automatically learn and recognize objects within the images. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained to classify images of cats and dogs by learning various features and patterns in the images, enabling it to distinguish between the two."
