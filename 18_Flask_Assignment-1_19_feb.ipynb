    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It provides a minimalistic yet powerful foundation for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight and Flexible: Flask is designed to be minimalistic and unopinionated, allowing developers to have more control and flexibility over their application's structure and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Easy to Learn and Use: Flask has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for beginners to get started. Its documentation is comprehensive and provides clear guidance for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensibility: Flask is highly extensible and allows developers to add additional functionality through various Flask extensions. These extensions provide ready-to-use features such as database integration, authentication, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Integration with Other Tools and Libraries: Flask seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and tools, allowing developers to leverage the vast Python ecosystem for tasks such as data manipulation, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: Flask's lightweight nature makes it well-suited for small to medium-sized applications. It can handle higher traffic volumes with the help of additional components like load balancers or by deploying it as part of larger frameworks like Django."
