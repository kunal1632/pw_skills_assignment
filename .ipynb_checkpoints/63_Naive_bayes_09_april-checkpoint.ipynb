    "## Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century mathematician and Presbyterian minister. It provides a way to update our beliefs or knowledge about an event when new evidence or information becomes available. The theorem is a formal representation of how we should revise our initial beliefs in light of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\$]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability, which represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. This is the updated probability after considering the new evidence.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood, which represents the probability of observing event B given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability, which represents our initial belief or knowledge about the probability of event A occurring before considering any new evidence.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the marginal probability, which represents the overall probability of observing event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event given new information related to that event. It is widely used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, medical diagnosis, and artificial intelligence. The theorem is the foundation of Bayesian inference, which is a powerful method for updating and refining probabilities based on data and evidence."

    "1. Medical Diagnosis: Bayes' theorem is used in medical diagnosis to estimate the probability of a patient having a particular disease given certain symptoms. By combining the patient's symptoms with prior knowledge of the disease's prevalence and the likelihood of those symptoms occurring with the disease, doctors can make more accurate diagnoses.\n",
