    "2. Business intelligence: Web scraping enables businesses to monitor and track information about their industry, competitors, or customers. By scraping relevant websites, companies can gather insights, such as pricing data, product details, customer reviews, and social media trends, to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Research and academic purposes: Researchers and academics often utilize web scraping to collect data for their studies and analysis. They can extract information from various sources, such as research papers, online databases, or social media platforms, to analyze trends, conduct sentiment analysis, or create datasets for further research."
